# Oblivion Remastered

## What does randomization do to this game?

In Oblivion Remastered, completing Daedric shrine quests will send location checks to the Archipelago server and grant items to other players in the multiworld. Meanwhile, you'll receive shrine unlock tokens and helpful items from other players to aid in your quest completion.

Instead of having immediate access to all shrine quests, you must receive **Shrine Tokens** from the multiworld to unlock specific shrines.

## What is the goal of Oblivion Remastered when randomized?

The goal depends on your settings:

- **Complete Specific Count:** Complete a configurable number of shrine quests (default: 10 out of available shrines)
- **Complete All Shrines:** Complete every shrine that spawns in your seed

Victory is achieved when you've completed the required number of Daedric shrine quests.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

- **Shrine Unlock Tokens:** Required to access specific Daedric shrine quests
- **Daedric Artifacts:** Powerful weapons and tools from completing shrines
- **Consumables:** Health/Magicka potions, magic scrolls, soul gems, and other helpful items

## Which items from other players can appear in Oblivion Remastered?

Any item from other Archipelago worlds can appear as rewards for completing shrine quests in Oblivion Remastered.

## What does another world's item look like in Oblivion Remastered?

-- not implemented. You are currently told you were "awarded with an Archipelago check"

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Items you receive from other players are automatically added to your inventory when you enter the game. A notification system alerts you to new items, and they're delivered via the game's console system.
